# SolarTrackerControlSimulation
🌞 Solar Tracker Control System
This project implements a solar tracking system that dynamically orients a solar panel to follow the sun's position using a PID-controlled motor. It leverages Simulink, Simscape Multibody, and Simscape Electrical for modeling the mechanics, electrical motor, and control logic.

✅ Features
🌐 Location-based solar irradiance modeling (Hyderabad example)

⚙️ Simscape Multibody: Models real-world mechanical rotation of the panel

🔌 Simscape Electrical: Simulates a motor driving the panel

🧠 PID Controller: Ensures precise tracking of the sun’s path

📊 Scope Outputs: Visualize panel angle, sun position, and power generation

🗂️ Clean project structure for easy simulation and sharing

⚙️ How It Works
Sun Position Algorithm: Calculates solar elevation for 24 hours using time and latitude.

Irradiance Modeling: Uses elevation to determine realistic solar irradiance curve.

Power Calculation: Uses panel area and efficiency to compute power.

PID Controller: Adjusts motor signal to track the optimal panel orientation.

Simulation: Shows real-time panel behavior and power output in Simulink.
